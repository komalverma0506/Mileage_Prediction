# In this a mpg dataset has been used to do mileage prediction using ML algorithms
  -  I have tried to predict the mileage using LinearRegression model, SGDRegressor Model, Decision Tree Model, and few more
  - I used Polynomial features as the data had polynomial relation with the target data, stratified sampling,GridCV to get the best parameter, though I was not successfull as the accuracy comes out to be more without using hyperparameter in SGDRegressor Model and was same in Linear regressor

<H2> The .ipynb file having the raw code for the same
